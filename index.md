### OBPMark (On Board Processing Benchmark) --- PRIVATE BETA
Contact: OBPMark@esa.int  
  
Authors/Chairs:  
David Steenari, European Space Agency (ESA)  
Dr. Leonidas Kosmidis, Barcelona Supercomputing Centre (BSC)  
  
Contributors:  
Ivan Rodriguez Ferrandez, BSC -- implementation and parallelisation of CCSDS compression algorithms.  
  
The OBPMark definition and implementation has been made available through the ESA "General Studies Programme (GSP)".  
  
## PRIVATE BETA VERSION NOTICE
Please note that OBPMark is currently in "Private Beta" while the implementations and verifications of the benchmarks are being completed.

Expect features and data to be missing. For an overview of the main current issues and missing features, see the "Issues" tab in the git repository.

The repository will be made "Public" when the first stabile version of OBPMark has been completed. This is expected in Q2 2021. 

In the meanwhile, users with access to the "Private Beta" version are invited to test out the existing implementations (see list below) and report bugs and issues via the github interface.

## Description
This repository contains a set of reference implementations for performing benchmarks on devices and systems on-board spacecraft. 

The following folders are in the repository: 

	docs/	The TeX files for building the OBPMark specification. 
	src/	Source files for each of the benchmarks. 

The benchmarks are organised in the following structure ("Private Beta" current status also shown): 

	src/1.1-image/				-- Sequential available. Parallel implementations to commited (BSC).
	src/1.2-radar/				-- Not available yet.
	src/2.1-data_compression/		-- Available. 
	src/2.2-image_compression/		-- mited (BSC).
	src/2.3-hyperspectral_compression/	-- Not available yet.
	src/3.1-aes_compression/		-- Not available yet.
	src/4.1-fir_filter/			-- Available in C (sequential), OpenMP, OpenCL and CUDA
	src/4.2-fft/				-- Available in C (sequential), OpenMP, OpenCL and CUDA.
	src/4.3-convolution/			-- Available in C (sequential), OpenMP, OpenCL and CUDA.
	src/4.4-matrix_multiplication/		-- Available in C (sequential), OpenMP, OpenCL and CUDA.
	src/5.1-object_detection/		-- Not available yet. 
	src/5.2-cloud_screening/		-- Not available yet.
	src/common/

The entire set of benchmarks can be built by invoking the Makefile in the top src/ directory, or by invoking the individual Makefiles in each of the src sub-directories.
